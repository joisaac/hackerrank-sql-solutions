## HackerRank
These are the solutions I coded in SQL for all [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) SQL exercises. See my [solutions](https://github.com/joisaac/sqlzoo-solutions) for [SQLZOO](https://napier.sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial), if you need more exercises.

Exercises are classified into:
- [Easy exercises](https://github.com/joisaac/hackerrank-sql-solutions/blob/main/easy-exercises.sql)
- [Medium exercises](https://github.com/joisaac/hackerrank-sql-solutions/blob/main/medium-exercises.sql)
- Hard exercises
